Started with nmap scan and found two ports open, 22 and 80
I decided to check the http website that is open on port 80 and decided to inspect the website
and found Note to self, remember username! Username: R1ckRul3s
I decided to do a gobuster scan and found assets, robots, and login.php with a status of 301 and 200, checked robots
I found "Wubbalubbadubdub" It seems like it is a password for the login page
So, I checked that after and was able to access the command page!
After that, I did ls and saw the first ingredient and did less first ingredient
And I was able to obtain the first flag
Then I tried to go around the files, but saw it resetting every time
So I decided to do a reverse shell using https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet, but
checked if Python is installed or not, using which python and which python3
and found python3, then I started listening on port 1234 with "nc -nlvp 1234"
And I managed to access the reverse shell!
looked around the files for a bit
and found the second ingredient in home/rick
After that, I decided to check root
But I needed to perform privilege escalation to root first
So I did sudo -l, and it didn't require a password
and did whoami and found www-data then
I did sudo bash -i, and I successfully became root and found the last flag in root/3rd.txt
